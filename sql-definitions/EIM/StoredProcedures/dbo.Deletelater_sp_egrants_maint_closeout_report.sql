Procedure Name:		sp_egrants_maint_closeout_report
Description:		generate grants close out report
Created:			Dan													
Modified:			On 03/31/2011 5:22 pm, Hareesh modified openquery linked server from impp1 to in Insert 
					Block of code
Modified:			On 04/01/2011 11:45 am, Hareesh commented out "is_closed_out" in 
					"detail multiple grant close date" and "detail grant close date" because "is_closed_out" column 
					does not exist in grants table of eim db. My investigations have uncovered that "to_be_destroyed" 
					column in grants table was earlier referred to as "is_closed_out" and someone might have renamed 
					it for reasons known to them
