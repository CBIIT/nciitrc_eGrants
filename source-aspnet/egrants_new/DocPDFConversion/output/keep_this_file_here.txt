Why is this file here ? And its parent directory ?

MLH :

The serverDocToPdf.ps1 script currently requires folders to keep its operations organized.
While the serverDocToPdf.ps1 script DOES have the intelligence to create these folders if they appear to be missing, security protocols appear to be hampering that activity.
Rather than pinning down what security protocols to adjust (and thereby incurring whatever scrutiny and wait cycles associated with it), adding these files to the VS solution
And setting them to "Content" and "Copy Always", will ensure that these files will remain available.
Thanks for stepping around this kludge and feel free to simplify this very complex process that exists only for converting the obsolete .doc files to .pdf in our
conversion process.
