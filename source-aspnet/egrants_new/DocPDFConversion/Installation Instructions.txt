Installation Instructions
Micah Hoover, 3/14/2025

This is a complex piece of software that needs to work with our existing eGrants web app.
In addition to some of the security protocol surprises, anyone facilitating the deployment of this functionality
must note that it is installed in very different locations in each environment (with slightly different, false
locations in each environment).

Here are the true destinations as of this writing :

	Dev (nciws-d2411-v):
		D:\Content\egrants-web-dev.nci.nih.gov\

	QA / test (nciws-Q2409-v):
		D:\Content\egrants.nci.nih.gov\

	Stage (nciws-s2408-v):
		D:\Content\egrants.nci.nih.gov\

	Prod (nciws-p974-v):
		D:\NCI Websites\egrants.nci.nih.gov\

Currently, I (Micah Hoover) am unable to access the path : D:\Content\egrants.nci.nih.gov\ On the eGrants QA web server (nciws-Q2409-v) 

If this has been deployed before, make sure to open the Windows Scheduled Tasks and delete "PowerShell HTTP Conversion Server", unless you are just making surgical tweak.

Here are the steps to get an environment set up for this :

1) Download Libre Office

2) Confirm Libre Office installation

	It must exist in the file system here :

		C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\soffice.exe

3) Deploy a branch of the eGrants app on Jenkins to the desired environment (if you're deploying to an upper tier environment, this should be in main or a build number branch to be provided)

4) Run one of the set up scripts in this directory with the corresponding environment name appended to the script name (e.g. createServerSchedTaskStage.ps1).

	You can do this by opening up a powershell prompt as an administrator (can hit the Windows key and type "powershell"), and then navigating to the directory with the set up script.

	Look at the specific environment pdf conversion environment above (e.g. D:\NCI Websites\egrants.nci.nih.gov\), then navigate to the DocPDFConversion directory.

	Then run the Powershell script with the correspondin environment name at the end of the script file.

	Example :

		.\createServerSchedTaskProd.ps1

	Let this finish to completion and discuss any errors you find with a developer.

	This will set up the new Libre Office conversion server as a Windows Scheduled Task.

5) Confirm that the new Windows Scheduled Task name appears in the Scheduled Tasks control panel and get it running.

	Hit the Windows key and type "Task Scheduler" Make sure that "PowerShell HTTP Conversion Server" appears as one of the entries.

	Now make sure that the status is "Running" and not "Ready". If it IS "Ready", then right click on it and choose "Run".

6) Confirm .doc files are converting to .pdf through the eGrants web app.

	This should succeed as nicely as it has in the dev environment.
